# IntGeometry
Swift Package library with geometric integer data types similar to [`CoreGraphics`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics)'s.  

This includes `IntPoint`, `IntSize` and `IntRect` which are functionally nearly identical to their counterparts [`CGPoint`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cgpoint), [`CGSize`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cgsize) and [`CGRect`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corefoundation/cgrect).  
However, they use integer values for coordinates and lengths instead of floating-point values.
